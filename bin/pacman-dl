# trick pacman into running as a normal user for downloading packages only.
# Utilises fakeroot to do this;
# certain directories must be writeable by the real user for this to work,
# namely /var/lib/pacman/sync and /var/cache/pacman/pkg.
# it is advised you keep /var/lib/pacman/local writeable only as root as per default,
# as this wrapper doesn't (and can't) actually perform installation changes.
# should be invoked as the user to run the download under.

# the referenced config file can be the same as the normal one for the most part.
# though, if you have any entries in IgnorePkg= of the regular pacman.conf for holding them back for manual upgrade,
# the pacman-dl.conf below should have those entries removed, else this script won't download them at all.

# invocation examples:
# pacman-dl -u -w (assume -S is already passed)
# pacman-dl <packagename>
exec fakeroot -- pacman --sync --downloadonly --config /etc/pacman-dl.conf "$@";
